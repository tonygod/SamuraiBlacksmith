  needWeaponText: "\"Knock knock.\u201D The distinctive pounding of a metal glove
    on wood precedes the entrance of a large armored man through the door to your
    shop. \u201CGood day, Blacksmith. My Katana was destroyed in my last battle. I
    require another with all due haste. I will return in 10 days time.\u201D"
  goodText: "\u201CKnock knock.\u201D You turn to see your client, filled to the brim
    with anticipation. \u201CExcellent! This is exactly what I wanted. I couldn\u2019t
    have hoped for a better sword. The samurai turns and departs. You feel a tang
    of sorrow, for you know you will never see this man again. Many soldiers had come
    before, and many will come again. Such is the nature of your business."
  okText: "\u201CKnock knock.\u201D You turn to see your client, filled to the brim
    with anticipation. \u201CThis will have to do. I must confess that the design
    leaves something to be desired. The samurai turns and departs. You let out a sigh
    of relief, for you know you will never see this man again. Many soldiers had come
    before, and many will come again. Such is the nature of your business."
  badText: "\u201CKnock knock.\u201D You turn to see your client, filled to the brim
    with anticipation. \u201CSeriously? Are you sure this is mine? Are you quite positive
    this\u2026 thing\u2026 wasn\u2019t ordered by some lowly, half-drunk tavern guard?
    Though it saddens me, my honor and yours demands your life be forfeit. May you
    find your peace in the next life.\u201D"
